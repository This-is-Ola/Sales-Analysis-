INSIGHT 
By comparing revenue across product categories, we can clearly identify which categories generate the most value for the business.
This helps assess consumer preferences, uncover underperforming product lines, 
and guide product management decisions such as inventory planning, marketing focus, and product discontinuation.

Direct Business Use Case:
Focus marketing efforts on high-performing categories.
Investigate why certain categories underperform (pricing, quality, demand).
Align product development with what customers are actually buying.
